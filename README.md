# Migration Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation

This project builds on Pan and Nagurney's Markov Chain migration model and create a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model for migration. We continue to view migration as a chained phenomenon, represented by a random walk through possible population distributions rather than a deterministic markov chain. These simulations can show us the dynamics of reaching equilibrium, and the sensitivity of equilibrium and convergence to initial populations, costs, and utility.
